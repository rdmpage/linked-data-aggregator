# This configuration file is designed to follow the structure of a BioSchemas dataset,
# e.g. https://bioschemas.org/profiles/Dataset
# so that it can be easily used to generate a RDF description of the data

# Name of the dataset
# Glue is just a dump of triples that link things together that I use for experiments
name: CITATION

# An identifier for the dataset, such as a DOI
identifier: https://figshare.org

# URL for the dataset, typically the home page of the dataset.
# Note that this URL will be used as the name of the graph for this data in the triple store

    # MIME type for the data, e.g. application/n-triples for triples
    # Note that if using Blazegraph as a triple store the MIME type for triples must be
    # text/rdf+n3 in order to preserve UTF-8 encoding
    # encodingFormat: application/n-triples
    encodingFormat: text/rdf+n3
